# Graph Explorer

Graph-explorer is an open-source low-code visual exploration tool for graph data, available under the Apache-2.0 license. It lets you browse either labeled property graphs (LPG) or Resource Description Framework (RDF) data in a graph database without having to write graph queries. Graph-explorer is intended to help data scientists, business analysts, and other roles in an organization explore graph data interactively without having to learn a graph query language.

Graph-explorer provides a React-based web application that can be deployed as a container to visualize graph data. You can connect to Amazon Neptune (Database or Analytics) or to other graph databases that provide an Apache TinkerPop Gremlin or SPARQL 1.1 endpoint.

- You can quickly see a summary of the data using the faceted filters, or search the data by typing text into the search bar.

- You can also interactively explore node and edge connections. You can view node neighbors to see how objects relate to each other, and then drill down to inspect edges and properties visually.

- You can also customize the graph layout, colors, icons, and which default properties to display for nodes and edges. For RDF graphs, you can customize namespaces for resource URIs too.

- For reports and presentations involving graph data, you can configure and save views you've created in a high-resolution PNG format. You can also download the associated data into a CSV or JSON file for further processing.
